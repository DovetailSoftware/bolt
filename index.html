</ul><p>This information is useful for determining an ID when adding a new custom table or view to the schema.</p>

<h3>Forms and Controls</h3>

<p>In the Forms section, you have read-only access to your Clarify Classic Client Forms. After searching for a form, you can view the form details which include the form's contextual objects, controls, child forms, tabs, and parent forms.</p>

<p>To search for and view forms:</p>

<li>Enter search criteria and click Search.</li>
<li>Find the form in the list and click the title.</li>

<p>If the control is a command button, you can click to view the details of the command button, including the privileges for the button, as well as any defined button actions.</p>

<p>To search for and view forms:</p>

<ol>
<li>From Bolt, select Forms.</li>
<li>Click on the search for a particular control link.</li>
<li>Enter search criteria and click Search.</li>
</ol><h3>Business Rules</h3>

<p>To search for business rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>From Bolt, select Business Rules.</li>
<li>
<p>Enter one or more search criteria and click Search.</p>

<pre><code>Note: All search filters are ANDed together.</code></pre>
</li>
</ol><h3>Database Info</h3>

<p>From Bolt, select Database Info to view how your database is set up, including ADP database header information, database flags, ADO information, and other miscellaneous database information.</p>

<h3>SQL</h3>

<p>From the SQL page, you can submit SQL queries to your database.</p>

<p>To submit an SQL query:</p>

<ol>
<li>From Bolt, select SQL.</li>
<li>Enter the SQL code and click Submit Query. The results are displayed at the bottom of the page.</li>
</ol><h3>Clarify Licenses</h3>

<p>The Clarify Licenses section lists all of your Clarify License information in an easily readable format. It contains the same information that would be returned by the following SQL query:</p>

<pre><code>select * from table_lic_count
</code></pre>

<h3>Database Connection</h3>

<p>From the administration page, you can configure the database connection:</p>

<ol>
<li>From the Bolt homepage, click Administration page.</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Provider and enter your User ID, Password, Server, and Database.</p>

<pre><code>Note: You only need to specify a database if you are using SQL Server.</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Submit.</p>

<pre><code>Note: If you get an error message after clicking Submit, the user running Bolt may not have permission to modify the connection information. This information is stored in the bolt.udl file. For more information about this problem, see the Knowledge Base article [Changing the login info in Bolt results in a Permission denied error](http://support.dovetailsoftware.com/selfservice/solutions/show/277).</code></pre>
</li>
</ol><h3>Customizing CSS</h3>

<p>You can use Bolt's style sheet, <i>style.css</i>, to customize Bolt's look and feel.</p>

<h3>Customizing Bolt Quick Links</h3>

<p>You can customize the Quick Links shown on the Schema page (schema.asp), which are global and seen by all Bolt users. By default, they link to a set of tables and views.</p>

<p>You can modify <i>inc/quicklinks.inc</i> with any text editor. The file is an array. Each element in the array is an object name and its object ID.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>LinkArray[LinkIndex] = [];
LinkArray[LinkIndex][1]= "rol_contct";
LinkArray[LinkIndex++][2]= "289";
</code></pre>

<p>You can remove any of the existing links, and add any of your own.</p>

<p>For example, to add the address table, you would use:</p>

<pre><code>LinkArray[LinkIndex] = [];
LinkArray[LinkIndex][1]= "address";
LinkArray[LinkIndex++][2]= "47";
</code></pre>
