By default, they link to a set of tables and views.\r\n\r\nYou can modify <i>inc/quicklinks.inc</i> with any text editor. The file is an array. Each element in the array is an object name and its object ID.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n\tLinkArray[LinkIndex] = [];\r\n\tLinkArray[LinkIndex][1]= \"rol_contct\";\r\n\tLinkArray[LinkIndex++][2]= \"289\";\r\n\r\nYou can remove any of the existing links, and add any of your own.\r\n\r\nFor example, to add the address table, you would use:\r\n\r\n\tLinkArray[LinkIndex] = [];\r\n\tLinkArray[LinkIndex][1]= \"address\";\r\n\tLinkArray[LinkIndex++][2]= \"47\";\r\n\r\n## Copyright Notice and Trademarks\r\n\r\n### Copyright ©2012 Dovetail Software, Inc.
