## Installation Guide


### Before You Begin

Review this section before you begin the installation.

#### Requirements

This version of Dovetail Bolt requires the following:

* **Clarify Version** - Any version
* **Database** - Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle
* **Web Server** - Microsoft IIS
* **Web Server Tools** - ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) or Appropriate Database Client Utilities
* **[Oracle Provider for OLE DB](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/windows/index-089115.html)** - for Oracle database connectivity

#### Limitations

Dovetail Bolt has the following limitations:

* Dovetail Bolt is not internationalized. It is only available in US English.


### Installing Dovetail Bolt

On your server, change to the location where Dovetail Bolt is to be installed.

[Clone the Repo](https://github.com/DovetailSoftware/bolt), or [download the repo as a zip file](https://github.com/DovetailSoftware/bolt/zipball/master).

If the repo was cloned, there should now be a bolt project folder, which will contain a copy of the Dovetail Bolt folders and files.

If the zip file was downloaded, extract the zip file into a folder. This folder will then contain a copy of the Dovetail Bolt folders and files.

The directory structure should like similar to this:

* bolt
 * code
 * files
 * tools


To finish the installation, you need to configure the Database Connection.

From the installation folder, open the code folder, and double-click (or open) the *bolt.udl* file.

Follow these steps to specify your database connection:

* For **Microsoft SQL Server**:
 * The Data Link Properties tool defaults to use the Microsoft SQL Server Provider.
 * On the Connection tab, enter a server name.
 * Choose the Use a specific user name and password option.
 * Enter the user name and password, and check Allow saving password. WARNING: If you do not check Allow saving password, Bolt will not work.
 * Enter a database name, and click OK.
* For **Oracle**:
 * Click the Provider tab.
 * Choose Oracle Provider for OLE DB (preferred) or the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Oracle.
 * On the Connection tab, enter a server name.
 * Enter the user name and password, and check Allow saving password. WARNING: If you do not check Allow saving password, Bolt will not work.
 * Click OK.
 * When a warning appears about saving your password to a file, click Yes. Saving your password is required for Bolt to work.


### Configure the web server 

#### IIS7 Configuration (on Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008)

ASP is disabled by default on IIS7. You must explicitly enable ASP and Server Side Includes. 

* Start Server Manager select the Web Server (IIS) Role. 
* Click on Add Role Services. 
* Under Application Development Features, make sure you have ASP and Server Side Includes selected.
* Under Common HTTP Features, the Static Content feature must be turned on.
* Also select the IIS 6 Management Compatibility features which are found near the bottom of the list of features.

Create a Application Pool
* Open IIS Manager: select Start - type IIS, and select Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager
* Click on your computer host name to expand the top-level node.
* Click on Application Pools
* Right-click on Application Pools and choose Add Application Pool
* Enter a name, such as BOLT_AppPool
* Set the .NET Framework Version to version 4.
* Set the Managed Pipeline Mode to Integrated.

Create the web application(s)
* Right-click Default Web Site and select Add Application
* In the Alias text box, type "BOLT" (without the quotes)
* Enter the path to the BOLT\code directory
* Select the BOLT Application Pool that you created earlier
* Select OK.

Enable Parent Paths
* Navigate to the BOLT web application in IIS Manager.
* Click on ASP.
* Set Enable Parent Paths to True.
* Click on Apply.

Test
* Using your web browser, navigate to http://server/bolt

#### File System Permissions

Depending on your server, O/S version, IIS version, Application Pool identity, and/or existing settings, you may need to explicitly set permissions. 
When navigating to the BOLT web application in your browser, you may receive an error such as:

```
HTTP Error 500.19 â€“ Internal Server Error
Description: The requested page cannot be accessed because the related configuration data for the page is invalid.
```

The account running the web application needs permissions for the ApplicationHost.config file or for the Web.config file indicated in the error message. Even if there is no config file at that location, the worker process identity (and/or the IIS_IUSRS group) needs at least Read access to the directory so that it can check for a web.config file in that directory. 

IUSR is the default user identity when using anonymous authentication. 
When IIS starts a worker process to serve a request it needs to start it under some token. This is your application pool identity (which you can set in the IIS manager). When this token is created, IIS automatically adds the IIS_IUSRS membership to the worker processes token at runtime. Therefore, the directory which has your application config file needs to have atleast Read permissions for the IIS_IUSRS group.

The solution here is to Grant Read access to IUSR and IIS_IUSRS

* Using Windows Explorer, right-clink on the $bolt\code folder and select Properties. 
* Select the Security tab
* Click the Edit button to modify permissions:
* Select the Add button
* In the "Select Users, Computers, Service Accounts, of Groups" dialog, click the Locations button and then select the Machine name at the top of the list. # Click OK.
* Click the Advanced button, followed by the Find Now button
* Select the IUSR and the IIS_IUSRS groups from the list and click OK.
* Make sure Read permission is selected for IUSR and IIS_IUSRS
* Click OK

http://www.dovetailsoftware.com/blogs/kmiller/archive/2008/08/19/installing-classic-asp-web-applications-on-iis7

#### IIS6 Configuration (on Windows Server 2003)

Note: The following assumes IIS version 6.0 on Microsoft Windows 2003. Your system may vary slightly.
ASP is disabled by default on Windows 2003. You must explicitly enable ASP and Server Side Includes. 

* Open the IIS Manager(Start->Administrative Tools->Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager)
* Expand the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager in the tree view on the left and then expand your computer's tree node. 
* Click on the "Web Service Extensions" node. 
* Click on "Active Server Pages" then click the "Allow" button. 
* Click on "Server Side Includes" then click the "Allow" button. 


### Security Considerations:

Dovetail Bolt provides quick and easy access to any of your Dovetail/Clarify environments. Access to a particular server and database is configured within the Administration page, and affects all users accessing Dovetail Bolt. While this is a very flexible feature, it opens up the possibility of users accessing an environment to which they should not have access, such as a production environment. Perform the following steps to ensure Dovetail Bolt is accessing the targeted environment as well as limit the SQL capabilities of users.

Within the *code/bolt.udl* file configuration, specify a database user that has read only permission to the database. This will prevent a user from issuing DROP, DELETE, ALTER or other potentially malicious or damaging statements that might corrupt your Dovetail/Clarify data.

Right-click the *code/bolt.udl* file, select 'Properties' from the menu and then check the 'Read-only' file attribute. This step prevents modification of the connection information to only those authorized by file permissions on the web server. Additionally, the Administration page within the Dovetail Bolt application will no longer be displayed. Setting this file property ensures that the configured Dovetail Bolt application will only access the database specified.

## Customization Guide

### Customizing the Dovetail Bolt Quick Links

You can customize the Quick Links shown on the Schema page (schema.asp), which are global and seen by all Dovetail Bolt users. By default, they link to a set of tables and views.

You can modify <i>inc/quicklinks.inc</i> with any text editor. The file is an array. Each element in the array is an object name and its object ID.

For example:

	LinkArray[LinkIndex] = [];
	LinkArray[LinkIndex][1]= "rol_contct";
	LinkArray[LinkIndex++][2]= "289";

You can remove any of the existing links, and add any of your own.

For example, to add the address table, you would use:

	LinkArray[LinkIndex] = [];
	LinkArray[LinkIndex][1]= "address";
	LinkArray[LinkIndex++][2]= "47";
